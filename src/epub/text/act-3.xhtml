									<span>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,</span>

									<span>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</span>

									<span>The day frowns more and more: thou’rt like to have</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A lullaby too rough: I never saw</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!</span>
